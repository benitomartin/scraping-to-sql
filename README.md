Justicio is a Question/Answering Assistant that generates answers from user questions about the official state gazette of Spain: Bolet√≠n Oficial del Estado (BOE).

[English link](https://www.boe.es/index.php?lang=en)

All BOE articles are embedded in vectors and stored in a vector database. When a question is asked, the question is embedded in the same latent space and the most relevant text is retrieved from the vector database by performing a query using the embedded question. The retrieved pieces of text are then sent to the LLM to construct an answer.
